RESOURCE TBUF r_manganese_name { buf="Comes from: manganesa\nMeaning: an ore called magnesia negra (the black\n         ore instead of the white one, magnesia\n         alba) was called manganesa, and finally\n         the metal isolated from it became known\n         as manganese"; }
RESOURCE TBUF r_manganese_other { buf="- is a gray-white metal, resembling iron\n- is found as a free element in nature (often in\n  combination with iron), and in many minerals\n- manganese ions are variously colored, and are\n  used industrially as pigments and as oxidation\n  chemicals"; }
RESOURCE TBUF r_manganese_other2 { buf="- is an essential trace nutrient in all forms of\n  life\n- acidic permanganate solutions will oxidize any\n  organic material they come into contact with, and\n  the oxidation process can generate enough heat to\n  ignite some organic substances"; }

RESOURCE TBUF r_technetium_other { buf="- on Earth, technetium occurs in trace but\n  measurable quantities as a product of\n  spontaneous fission in uranium ore or by\n  neutron capture in molybdenum ores\n- is a silvery-grey radioactive metal with an\n  appearance similar to platinum"; }
RESOURCE TBUF r_technetium_other2 { buf="- plays no natural biological role and is not\n  normally found in the human body\n- technetium-98 has a half-life of 4.2 million\n  years"; }
RESOURCE TBUF r_technetium_other3 { buf="- technetium-99m (the m indicates that this is a\n  metastable nuclear isomer) is used in radioactive\n  isotope medical tests, for example as a\n  radioactive tracer that medical equipment can\n  detect in the human body"; }

RESOURCE TBUF r_rhenium_other { buf="- in 1908 a Japanese chemist Masataka Ogawa\n  announced that he discovered the 43rd element,\n  and named it nipponium (Np) after Japan (which\n  is Nippon in Japanese) - however, later analysis\n  indicated the presence of rhenium (element 75),\n  not element 43 - the symbol Np was later used\n  for the element neptunium"; }
RESOURCE TBUF r_rhenium_other2 { buf="- is a silvery white metal with one of the highest\n  melting points of all elements\n- is probably not found free in nature\n- is used in high-temperature superalloys that are\n  used to make jet engine parts, making 70% of the\n  worldwide production"; }
