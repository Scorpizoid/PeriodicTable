RESOURCE TBUF r_mercury_other { buf="- the symbol Hg comes from hydrargyrum, a Latinized\n  form of the Greek word hydrargyros, which is a\n  compound word meaning 'water' and 'silver'\n  since it is liquid, like water, and yet has a\n  silvery metallic sheen"; }
RESOURCE TBUF r_mercury_other2 { buf="- alchemists thought of mercury as the First Matter\n  from which all metals were formed - they believed\n  that different metals could be produced by\n  varying the quality and quantity of sulfur\n  contained within the mercury"; }
