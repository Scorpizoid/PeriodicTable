<font size=4em>Helium</font>
<p><b>Symbol</b>: He<BR>
<b>Atomic number</b>: 2<BR>
<b>Category</b>: noble gases<BR>
<b>Group</b>: 18<BR>
<b>Period</b>: 1<BR>
<b>Block</b>: s<BR>
<b>Standard atomic weight</b>: 4.002602<BR>
<b>Electrons per shell</b>: 2<BR>
<b>CAS number</b>: 7440-59-7<BR>
<b>Phase</b>: gas<BR>
<b>Density</b>: 0.1786 g/l (0 °C, 101.325 kPa)<BR>
<b>Melting point</b>: 0.95 K (-272.20 °C, -457.96 °F) (at 2.5 MPa)<BR>
<b>Boiling point</b>: 4.22 K (-268.93 °C, -452.07 °F)<BR>
<b>Crystal structure</b>: hexagonal close-packed<BR>
<b>Oxidation states</b>: 0<BR>
<b>Electronegativity</b>: unknown<BR>
<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>Helios</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: the Greek name for Sun because the discoverer concluded this element is found in the Sun
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert monatomic gas
<BR>- its boiling and melting points are the lowest among the elements and it exists only as a gas except in extreme conditions
<BR>- is used in cryogenics, in deep-sea breathing systems, to cool superconducting magnets, in helium dating, for inflating balloons, for providing lift in airships and as a protective gas for many industrial uses (such as arc welding and growing silicon wafers)
<BR>- inhaling a small volume of the gas temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice
<BR>- is the second lightest element and is the second most abundant in the observable Universe
<BR>- most helium was formed during the Big Bang, but new helium is being created as a result of the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars
<BR>- has two liquid states - helium I and helium II - helium II is a superfluid which has the same viscosity as the gaseous helium
<BR>- at standard conditions is non-toxic, plays no biological role and is found in trace amounts in human blood - if enough helium is inhaled that oxygen needed for normal respiration is replaced asphyxia is possible</p>
