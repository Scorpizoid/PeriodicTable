<b>Category</b>: actinides<BR>
<b>Group</b>: 3<BR>
<b>Period</b>: 7<BR>
<b>Block</b>: f<BR>
<b>Standard atomic weight</b>: (227)<BR>
<b>Electrons per shell</b>: 2, 8, 18, 32, 18, 9, 2<BR>
<b>CAS number</b>: 7440-34-8<BR>
<b>Phase</b>: solid<BR>

<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>aktinos</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: a Greek word which means a beam
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- was the first non-primordial radioactive element to be isolated, although polonium, radium and radon were observed before, but not isolated until 1902
<BR>- gave the name to the actinide series
<BR>- is a silvery, radioactive, metallic element
<BR>- due to its intense radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light
<BR>- is found in trace amounts in uranium ore, but more commonly is made in milligram amounts by the neutron irradiation of radium-226 in a nuclear reactor
<BR>- actinium metal has been prepared by the reduction of actinium fluoride with lithium vapor at about 1100 °C to 1300 °C
<BR>- is about 150 times as radioactive as radium, making it valuable as a neutron source for energy
<BR>- has no significant industrial applications
<BR>- is even more dangerous than plutonium, and ingesting even small amounts of actinium-227 would be fatal
<BR>- naturally occurring actinium is composed of 1 radioactive isotope with a half-life of 21.772 years</p>
