<font size=4em>Californium </font>
<p><b>Symbol</b>: Cf<BR>
<b>Atomic number</b>: 98<BR>
<b>Category</b>: actinides<BR>
<b>Group</b>: n/a<BR>
<b>Period</b>: 7<BR>
<b>Block</b>: f<BR>
<b>Standard atomic weight</b>: (251)<BR>
<b>Electrons per shell</b>: 2, 8, 18, 32, 28, 8, 2<BR>
<b>CAS number</b>: 7440-71-3<BR>
<b>Phase</b>: solid<BR>
<b>Density</b>: 15.1 kg/l (near room temperature)<BR>
<b>Melting point</b>: 1173 K (900 °C, 1652 °F)<BR>
<b>Boiling point</b>: 1743 K (1470 °C, 2678 °F)<BR>
<b>Crystal structure</b>: hexagonal<BR>
<b>Oxidation states</b>: 2, 3, 4<BR>
<b>Electronegativity</b>: 1.3 (Pauling scale)<BR>
<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>California</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: a research group in University of California, Berkeley discovered the element and named it after the state
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- a radioactive transuranic element
<BR>- is used in starting nuclear reactors, optimizing coal-fired power plants and cement production facilities (via online analyzers), medical treatment of cancer, and oil exploration via down hole well logging
<BR>- was first produced by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium ions)
<BR>- twenty radioisotopes of californium have been characterized, the most stable being californium- 251 with a half-life of 898 years
<BR>- although californium does not occur naturally on Earth, the element and its decay products occur elsewhere in the universe
<BR>- has no biological role and only a few californium compounds have been made and studied
<BR>- is extremely radioactive and harmful</p>
