<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>carbo</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: a Latin word meaning charcoal as carbon is found in it
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- has lots of allotropic forms - e.g. diamond, amorphous carbon, graphite and fullerene
<BR>- is the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen
<BR>- is present in all known lifeforms, and in the human body carbon is the second most abundant element by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen
<BR>- is the chemical basis of all known life
<BR>- all the allotropic forms are solids under normal conditions
<BR>- pure carbon has extremely low toxicity and can be handled and even ingested safely in the form of graphite or charcoal graphite is the most thermodynamically stable
<BR>- diamond is among the hardest materials known, while graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper
<BR>- diamond has the highest thermal conductivity of all known materials</p>
