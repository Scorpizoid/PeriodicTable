<font size=4em>Aluminium</font>
<p><b>Symbol</b>: Al<BR>
<b>Atomic number</b>: 13<BR>
<b>Category</b>: post-transition metals<BR>
<b>Group</b>: 13<BR>
<b>Period</b>: 3<BR>
<b>Block</b>: p<BR>
<b>Standard atomic weight</b>: 26.9815386<BR>
<b>Electrons per shell</b>: 2, 8, 3<BR>
<b>CAS number</b>: 7429-90-5<BR>
<b>Phase</b>: solid<BR>
<b>Density</b>: 2.70 kg/l (near room temperature)<BR>
<b>Melting point</b>: 933.47 K (660.32 °C, 1220.58 °F)<BR>
<b>Boiling point</b>: 2792 K (2519 °C, 4566 °F)<BR>
<b>Crystal structure</b>: face centered cubic<BR>
<b>Oxidation states</b>: 3, 2, 1<BR>
<b>Electronegativity</b>: 1.61 (Pauling scale)<BR>
<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>alumium</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: the name that the chemist-inventor Humphry Davy gave to the metal base of the mineral alumina
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, and the third most abundant element therein, after oxygen and silicon
<BR>- makes up about 8% by weight of the Earth's solid surface
<BR>- is too reactive chemically to occur in nature as a free metal - instead, it is found combined in over 270 different minerals
<BR>- is remarkable for its ability to resist corrosion (due to the phenomenon of passivation) and its low density
<BR>- is used in aerospace industry, transportation and building, and as a catalyst or additive in chemical mixtures, including being used in ammonium nitrate explosives to enhance blast power
<BR>- has nine isotopes, whose mass numbers range from 23 to 30 
<BR>- is 100% recyclable without any loss of its natural qualities</p>
