<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- the symbol Hg comes from hydrargyrum, a Latinized form of the Greek word hydrargyros, which is a compound word meaning 'water' and 'silver' since it is liquid, like water, and yet has a silvery metallic sheen
<BR>- alchemists thought of mercury as the First Matter from which all metals were formed - they believed that different metals could be produced by varying the quality and quantity of sulfur contained within the mercury
<BR>- heavy, silvery d-block metal, mercury is one of six elements that are liquid at or near room temperature and pressure, the others being caesium, francium, gallium, bromine, and rubidium
<BR>- is the only metal liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure, with a melting point of -38.83 °C
<BR>- occurs in deposits throughout the world as cinnabar (mercuric sulfide), source of the red pigment vermilion
<BR>- is used in thermometers, barometers, manometers, sphygmomanometers, float valves, and other scientific apparatus
<BR>- mercury and most of its compounds are extremely toxic and are generally handled with care
<BR>- has been used in dental amalgams </p>
