<font size=4em>Terbium</font>
<p><b>Symbol</b>: Tb<BR>
<b>Atomic number</b>: 65<BR>
<b>Category</b>: lanthanides<BR>
<b>Group</b>: n/a<BR>
<b>Period</b>: 6<BR>
<b>Block</b>: f<BR>
<b>Standard atomic weight</b>: 158.92535<BR>
<b>Electrons per shell</b>: 2, 8, 18, 27, 8, 2<BR>
<b>CAS number</b>: 7440-27-9<BR>
<b>Phase</b>: solid<BR>
<b>Density</b>: 8.23 kg/l (near room temperature)<BR>
<b>Melting point</b>: 1629 K (1356 °C, 2473 °F)<BR>
<b>Boiling point</b>: 3503 K (3230 °C, 5846 °F)<BR>
<b>Crystal structure</b>: hexagonal<BR>
<b>Oxidation states</b>: 3, 4<BR>
<b>Electronegativity</b>: 1.2 (Pauling scale)<BR>
<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>terbia</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: when the mineral yttria was partitioned into three fractions, the 'terbia' was the fraction that contained the pink color (due to what now is known as erbium)
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is a silvery-white rare earth metal that is malleable, ductile and soft enough to be cut with a knife
<BR>- is reasonably stable in air (it does not tarnish after nineteen months at room temperature)
<BR>- two crystal allotropes exist, with a transformation temperature of 1289 °C between them
<BR>- is used to dope calcium fluoride, calcium tungstate and strontium molybdate, materials that are used in solid-state devices, and as a crystal stabilizer of fuel cells which operate at elevated temperatures
<BR>- is also used in alloys and in the production of electronic devices
<BR>- is never found in nature as a free element, but it is contained in many minerals, including cerite, gadolinite, monazite, xenotime and euxenite
<BR>- the richest current commercial sources of terbium are the ion-adsorption clays of southern China
<BR>- can be produced by reducing the anhydrous chloride or fluoride with calcium metal in a tantalum crucible - calcium and tantalum impurities can be removed by vacuum remelting
<BR>- as with the other lanthanides, terbium compounds are of low to moderate toxicity, although their toxicity has not been investigated in detail</p>
