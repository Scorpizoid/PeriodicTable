<font size=4em>Promethium</font>
<p><b>Symbol</b>: Pm<BR>
<b>Atomic number</b>: 61<BR>
<b>Category</b>: lanthanides<BR>
<b>Group</b>: n/a<BR>
<b>Period</b>: 6<BR>
<b>Block</b>: f<BR>
<b>Standard atomic weight</b>: [145]<BR>
<b>Electrons per shell</b>: 2, 8, 18, 23, 8, 2<BR>
<b>CAS number</b>: 7440-12-2<BR>
<b>Phase</b>: solid<BR>
<b>Density</b>: 7.26 kg/l (near room temperature)<BR>
<b>Melting point</b>: 1315 K (1042 °C, 1908 °F)<BR>
<b>Boiling point</b>: 3273 K (3000 °C, 5432 °F)<BR>
<b>Crystal structure</b>: hexagonal<BR>
<b>Oxidation states</b>: 3<BR>
<b>Electronegativity</b>: 1.13 (Pauling scale)<BR>
<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>Prometheus</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: the Titan, in Greek mythology, who stole the fire from Mount Olympus and brought it down to mankind - the name was suggested by the discoverer's wife, who felt that they were stealing fire from the gods
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is notable for being the only other exclusively radioactive element besides technetium which is followed by chemical elements that have stable isotopes
<BR>- its longest lived isotope 145Pm is a soft beta emitter with a half-life of 17.7 years
<BR>- does not emit gamma rays, but beta particles impinging on elements of high atomic numbers can generate X-rays
<BR>- exists in two allotropic forms, and its chemistry is similar to other lanthanides
<BR>- promethium salts luminesce in the dark with a pale blue or greenish glow, due to their high radioactivity
<BR>- is used as a beta radiation source for thickness gauges, in a nuclear battery and in the future, portable X-ray sources
<BR>- can be formed in nature as a product of spontaneous fission of uranium-238 and alpha decay of europium-151
<BR>- it was calculated that the equilibrium mass of promethium in the Earth's crust is about 560 g due to uranium fission and about 12 g due to the recently observed alpha decay of europium-151</p>
