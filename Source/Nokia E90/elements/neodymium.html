<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>neos and didymos</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: Greek words which mean new and twin
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is present in Mischmetal to the extent of about 18%
<BR>- has a bright, silvery metallic luster; however, as one of the more reactive rare earth (Lanthanide) metals, it quickly oxidizes in air
<BR>- the oxide layer then falls off, which exposes the metal for further oxidation
<BR>- although a rare earth metal, neodymium is not rare at all - it constitutes 38 ppm of the Earth's crust
<BR>- neodymium magnets are the strongest permanent magnets known
<BR>- is frequently misspelled as neodynium
<BR>- is never found in nature as the free element; rather, it occurs in ores such as monazite sand
<BR>- neodymium metal dust is a combustion and explosion hazard
<BR>- commercially available magnets made from neodymium are exceptionally strong, and can attract each other from large distances - if not handled carefully, they could come together very quickly and forcefully, causing injuries</p>
