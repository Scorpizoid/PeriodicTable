<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is a rare earth metal, with a bright silver luster
<BR>- is reasonably stable in air; it ignites in air at 150 °C
<BR>- even with long-term storage under mineral oil, samarium is gradually oxidized, with a grayish- yellow powder of the oxide-hydro
<BR>- the metallic appearance of a sample can be preserved by sealing it under an inert gas such as argon
<BR>- is used e.g. in carbon-air lighting, as a neutron absorber, for alloys, for headphone magnets
<BR>- is never found free in nature, but, like other rare earth elements, is contained in many minerals, including monazite, bastnäsite and samarskite
<BR>- is of low to moderate toxicity, although their toxicity has not been investigated in detail
<BR>- is composed of four stable isotopes, and three extremely long-lived radioisotopes</p>
