<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is a soft, bluish-white transition metal
<BR>- is a relatively abundant element
<BR>- was discovered in 1817 by Friedrich Strohmeyer as an impurity in zinc carbonate
<BR>- was for a long time used as pigment and for corrosion resistant plating on steel
<BR>- with the exception of its use in nickel-cadmium batteries, the use of cadmium is generally decreasing in all other applications
<BR>- is considered highly toxic and carcinogenic
<BR>- although cadmium is toxic, one enzyme, a carbonic anhydrase with a cadmium as reactive centre has been discovered
<BR>- in 2001, China was the top producer of cadmium with almost one-sixth world share closely followed by South Korea and Japan</p>
