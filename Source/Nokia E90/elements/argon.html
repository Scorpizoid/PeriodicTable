<font size=4em>Argon</font>
<p><b>Symbol</b>: Ar<BR>
<b>Atomic number</b>: 18<BR>
<b>Category</b>: noble gases<BR>
<b>Group</b>: 18<BR>
<b>Period</b>: 3<BR>
<b>Block</b>: p<BR>
<b>Standard atomic weight</b>: 39.948<BR>
<b>Electrons per shell</b>: 2, 8, 8<BR>
<b>CAS number</b>: 7440-37-1<BR>
<b>Phase</b>: gas<BR>
<b>Density</b>: 1.784 g/l (0 °C, 101.325 kPa)<BR>
<b>Melting point</b>: 83.80 K (-189.35 °C, -308.83 °F)<BR>
<b>Boiling point</b>: 87.30 K (-185.85 °C, -302.53 °F)<BR>
<b>Crystal structure</b>: cubic face centered<BR>
<b>Oxidation states</b>: 0<BR>
<b>Electronegativity</b>: inert<BR>
<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>argon</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: a Greek word which means 'inactive' due to the element's inactivity
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is present in the Earth's atmosphere at 0.93% by volume
<BR>- is the most abundant and most frequently used of the noble gases
<BR>- is colorless, odorless, tasteless and nontoxic in both its liquid and gaseous forms
<BR>- up until 1957 its symbol was only A
<BR>- argon was thought to be inert and unable to form any compounds, but in August 2000 the first argon compound was formed by researchers in Finland
<BR>- by shining ultraviolet light onto frozen argon containing a small amount of hydrogen fluoride, argon fluorohydride (HArF) was formed
<BR>- is used e.g as a fire extinguisher gas, metal inert gas welding, as a preservative and in laboratory gloveboxes
<BR>- cryosurgery procedures such as cryoablation use liquefied argon to destroy cancer cells
<BR>- although argon is non-toxic, it does not satisfy the body's need for oxygen and is thus an asphyxiant</p>
