<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is a silvery white, weakly radioactive metal, which is slightly softer than steel, strongly electropositive and a poor electrical conductor
<BR>- is malleable, ductile, and slightly paramagnetic
<BR>- has very high density, being approximately 70% higher than that of lead, but slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten
<BR>- in nature, uranium atoms exist as uranium-238 (99.284%), uranium-235 (0.711%),[2] and a very small amount of uranium-234 (0.0058%)
<BR>- is used e.g. in the nuclear reactors, bombs and as a colorant in uranium glass, producing orange-red to lemon yellow hues
<BR>- the half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 billion years and that of uranium-235 is 704 million years, making them useful in dating the age of the Earth
<BR>- normal functioning of the kidney, brain, liver, heart, and other systems can be affec uranium exposure, because, in addition to being weakly radioactive, uranium is a toxic metal
<BR>- finely divided uranium metal presents a fire hazard because uranium is pyrophoric; small grains will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature</p>
