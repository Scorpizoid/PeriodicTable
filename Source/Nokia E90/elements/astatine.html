<font size=4em>Astatine</font>
<p><b>Symbol</b>: At<BR>
<b>Atomic number</b>: 85<BR>
<b>Category</b>: metalloids, halogens<BR>
<b>Group</b>: 17<BR>
<b>Period</b>: 6<BR>
<b>Block</b>: p<BR>
<b>Standard atomic weight</b>: (210)<BR>
<b>Electrons per shell</b>: 2, 8, 18, 32, 18, 7<BR>
<b>CAS number</b>: 7440-68-8<BR>
<b>Phase</b>: solid<BR>
<b>Density</b>: 4.933 kg/l (near room temperature)<BR>
<b>Melting point</b>: 575 K (302 °C, 576 °F)<BR>
<b>Boiling point</b>: 610 K (337 °C, 639 °F)<BR>
<b>Crystal structure</b>: unknown<BR>
<b>Oxidation states</b>: 1, 3, 5, 7<BR>
<b>Electronegativity</b>: 2.2 (Pauling scale)<BR>
<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>astatos</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: a Greek word which means 'unstable' due to its relatively short half-life of about 8 hours
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is a radioactive element with 33 known isotopes with mass numbers between 191 and 223
<BR>- the longest-lived isotope is astatine-210, which has half-life of 8.1 hours; the shortest-lived known isotope is astatine-213, which has a half-life of 125 nanoseconds
<BR>- is produced by radioactive decay in nature, due to its short half life it is found only in minute amounts
<BR>- the alpha-emitting properties of some astatine isotopes are used for science applications, and also medical applications for astatine 211 are tested
<BR>- would be expected to be a nearly black solid, which, when heated, sublimes into a dark, purplish vapor (darker than iodine)
<BR>- is the least reactive of the halogens, being less reactive than iodine
<BR>- has been proposed with names <i>dakin</i> and <i>helvetium</i></p>
