<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- has a bright silvery appearance at first, much like nickel, but it oxidizes very quickly to a dull gray, although yellow and olive green are also reported
<BR>- is about as hard and brittle as grey cast iron unless it is alloyed with other metals
<BR>- is not a good conductor of heat or electricity
<BR>- has six allotropes, from alpha- to zeta-plutonium
<BR>- has wenty radioactive isotopes, of which the longest-lived is plutonium-244, with a half-life of 80.8 million years
<BR>- the most important isotope of plutonium is plutonium-239, with a half-life of 24,100 years
<BR>- when exposed to moist air, it forms oxides and hydrides that expand the sample up to 70% in volume, which in turn flake off as a powder that can spontaneously ignite
<BR>- is used in nuclear weapons and use in some nuclear reactors
<BR>- is also a radioactive poison that accumulates in bone marrow
<BR>- reacts with carbon, halogens, nitrogen and silicon</p>
