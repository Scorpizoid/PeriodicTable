<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>Phosphorus</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: in Ancient Greece it was the name of the planet Venus, and is derived from words which translate as 'light carrier'
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is commonly found in inorganic phosphate rocks
<BR>- due to its high reactivity, phosphorus is never found as a free element in nature on Earth
<BR>- is a component of DNA, RNA, ATP, and also the phospholipids which form all cell membranes
<BR>- the most important commercial use of phosphorus- based chemicals is the production of fertilizers
<BR>- is also widely used in explosives, nerve agents, friction matches, fireworks, pesticides, toothpaste and detergents
<BR>- emits a faint glow upon exposure to oxygen
<BR>- a wide range of organophosphorus compounds are used for their toxicity to certain organisms as pesticides (herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, etc.) and weaponized as nerve agents
<BR>- chronic white phosphorus poisoning leads to necrosis of the jaw called 'phossy jaw'
<BR>- the white phosphorus allotrope should be kept under water at all times as it presents a significant fire hazard due to its extreme reactivity with atmospheric oxygen, and it should only be manipulated with forceps since contact with skin can cause severe burns </p>
