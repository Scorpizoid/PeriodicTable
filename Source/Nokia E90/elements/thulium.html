<b>Group</b>: n/a<BR>
<b>Period</b>: 6<BR>
<b>Block</b>: f<BR>
<b>Standard atomic weight</b>: 168.93421<BR>
<b>Electrons per shell</b>: 2, 8, 18, 31, 8, 2<BR>
<b>CAS number</b>: 7440-30-4<BR>
<b>Phase</b>: solid<BR>
<b>Density</b>: 9.32 kg/l (near room temperature)<BR>

<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>Thule</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: the name of Scandinavia in classical literature - the discoverer was Swedish
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is the least abundant of the rare earths
<BR>- is an easily workable metal with a bright silvery-gray luster and can be cut by a knife
<BR>- has some corrosion resistance in dry air and good ductility
<BR>- naturally occurring thulium is made entirely of the stable isotope thulium-169
<BR>- as a rare and expensive, thulium does not have many practical applications
<BR>- has been used to create laser lights, but production costs have been too high for commercial use
<BR>- is never found in nature in pure form, but it is found in small quantities in minerals with other rare earths
<BR>- is used as interstellar money in the book Illegal Aliens, due to its rarity and lack of other uses
<BR>- has a low-to-moderate degree of acute toxicity and should be handled with care, and metallic thulium in dust form presents a fire and explosion hazard</p>
