<font size=4em>Fluorine</font>
<p><b>Symbol</b>: F<BR>
<b>Atomic number</b>: 9<BR>
<b>Category</b>: diatomic nonmetals, halogens<BR>
<b>Group</b>: 17<BR>
<b>Period</b>: 2<BR>
<b>Block</b>: p<BR>
<b>Standard atomic weight</b>: 18.9984032<BR>
<b>Electrons per shell</b>: 2, 7<BR>
<b>CAS number</b>: 7782-41-4<BR>
<b>Phase</b>: gas<BR>
<b>Density</b>: 1.7 g/l (0 °C, 101.325 kPa)<BR>
<b>Melting point</b>: 53.53 K (-219.62 °C, -363.32 °F)<BR>
<b>Boiling point</b>: 85.03 K (-188.12 °C, -306.62 °F)<BR>
<b>Crystal structure</b>: cubic<BR>
<b>Oxidation states</b>: -1<BR>
<b>Electronegativity</b>: 3.98 (Pauling scale)<BR>
<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>fluere</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: a Latin word which means 'to flow' - fluorine was used as a flux which promotes the flow of molten metals
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- forms a single bond with itself in elemental form, resulting in the diatomic F2 molecule
<BR>- is a supremely reactive, poisonous, pale, yellowish brown gas
<BR>- is the most chemically reactive and electro- negative of all the elements
<BR>- is highly dangerous because it readily burns hydrocarbons, more so than other halogens such as the poisonous chlorine gas
<BR>- though F<sub>2</sub> is too reactive to have any natural biological role, fluorine is incorporated into compounds with biological activity
<BR>- is not an essential nutrient, but its important in preventing tooth decay is well-recognized, and thus used in tooth pastes
<BR>- has a characteristic pungent odor that is detectable in concentrations as low as 20 ppb
<BR>- the lethal dose of sodium fluoride in rats is 52 mg/kg</p>
