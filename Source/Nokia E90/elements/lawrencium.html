<b>Atomic number</b>: 103<BR>
<b>Category</b>: actinides<BR>
<b>Group</b>: n/a<BR>
<b>Period</b>: 7<BR>
<b>Block</b>: f<BR>
<b>Standard atomic weight</b>: (262)<BR>
<b>Electrons per shell</b>: 2, 8, 18, 32, 32, 8, 3<BR>
<b>CAS number</b>: 22537-19-5<BR>
<b>Phase</b>: presumably a solid<BR>
<b>Density</b>: unknown<BR>

<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is a radioactive synthetic element
<BR>- twelve isotopes of lawrencium have been synthesized with lawrencium-262 being the longest-lived and heaviest, with a half-life of 216 minutes
<BR>- was produced by bombarding a three milligram target composed of three isotopes of californium with boron-10 and boron-11 ions
<BR>- the appearance of this element is unknown, however it is most likely silvery-white or gray and metallic
<BR>- if sufficient amounts of lawrencium were produced, it would pose a radiation hazard
<BR>- its symbol was formerly known as Lw
<BR>- is a synthetic element and has no known uses</p>
