<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>Albert Einstein</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: in honor of the theoretical physicist
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is a metallic synthetic element
<BR>- its chemical and physical properties are similar to other metals
<BR>- though only small amounts have ever been made, it has been determined to be silver-colored
<BR>- like all synthetic elements, isotopes of einsteinium are extremely radioactive, and are considered highly toxic
<BR>- does not occur naturally in any measurable quantities
<BR>- the modern process of creating the element starts with the irradiation of plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor for several years
<BR>- has no known uses, other than radiation-related
<BR>- nineteen radioisotopes of einsteinium have been characterized, with the most stable being einsteinium-252 with a half-life of 471.7 days</p>
