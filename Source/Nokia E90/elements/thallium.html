<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- a soft gray malleable poor metal which resembles tin but discolors when exposed to air
<BR>- approximately 60-70% of thallium production is used in the electronics industry, and the rest is used in the pharmaceutical industry and in glass manufacturing
<BR>- is highly toxic and is used in rat poisons and insecticides, but its use has been cut back or eliminated in many countries
<BR>- because of its use for murder, thallium has gained the nicknames 'The Poisoner's Poison' and 'Inheritance Powder' (alongside arsenic)
<BR>- thallium metal is obtained as a by-product in the production of sulfuric acid by roasting of pyrite, and also in the smelting of lead and zinc ores</p>
