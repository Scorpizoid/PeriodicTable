<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>antimonium</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: the Latin word for 'monk-killer', as the early alchemists were monks, and antimony is poisonous
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- the symbol Sb comes from the Latin word Stibium which means 'mark'
<BR>- has four allotropic forms
<BR>- the stable form of antimony is a blue-white metalloid, and the yellow and the black antimony are unstable non-metals
<BR>- is used in flame-proofing, paints, ceramics, enamels, a wide variety of alloys, electronics, and rubber
<BR>- is a silvery white, brittle, fusible, crystalline solid that exhibits poor electrical and heat conductivity properties and vaporizes at low temperatures
<BR>- antimony and many of its compounds are toxic - clinically, antimony poisoning is very similar to arsenic poisoning
<BR>- was used in Biblical times as a medicine, and in Islamic/Pre-Islamic times as a cosmetic</p>
