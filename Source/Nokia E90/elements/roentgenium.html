<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is a synthetic element
<BR>- its most stable known isotope has a mass of 283 amu and an estimated half-life of ten minutes
<BR>- was found by Peter Armbruster, Gottfried Münzenberg, and their team working at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany on December 8, 1994, but the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party (JWP) concluded that there was insufficient evidence for the discovery at that time
<BR>- the GSI team repeated their experiment in 2000 and detected a further 3 atoms, and in their 2003 report, the JWP decided that the GSI team should be acknowledged as the discoverers</p>
