<b>Group</b>: 14<BR>
<b>Period</b>: 6<BR>
<b>Block</b>: p<BR>
<b>Standard atomic weight</b>: 207.2<BR>
<b>Electrons per shell</b>: 2, 8, 18, 32, 18, 4<BR>
<b>CAS number</b>: 7439-92-1<BR>
<b>Phase</b>: solid<BR>
<b>Density</b>: 11.34 kg/l (near room temperature)<BR>
<b>Melting point</b>: 600.61 K (327.46 °C, 621.43 °F)<BR>
<b>Boiling point</b>: 2022 K (1749 °C, 3180 °F)<BR>
<b>Crystal structure</b>: cubic face centered<BR>
<b>Oxidation states</b>: 4, 2<BR>
<b>Electronegativity</b>: 2.33 (Pauling scale)<BR>
<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>lot</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: the German word for 'weight', as the element is very heavy, and is used in weights
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- in Latin, lead was called plumbum; in Rome, lead was used for plumbing
<BR>- is a soft, malleable poor metal, also considered to be one of the heavy metals
<BR>- has a bluish-white color when freshly cut, but tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air
<BR>- has a shiny chrome-silver luster when melted into a liquid
<BR>- like mercury, another heavy metal, lead is a potent neurotoxin that accumulates in soft tissues and bone over time
<BR>- is used in building construction, lead-acid batteries, bullets and shot, weights, and is part of solder, pewter, fusible alloys and radiation shields
<BR>- has the highest atomic number of all stable elements, although the next element, bismuth, has a half-life so long (longer than the estimated age of the universe) it can be considered stable</p>
