<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is a silvery-white, malleable and ductile rare- earth metal with a metallic lustre
<BR>- crystallizes in hexagonal, close-packed alpha form at room temperature, but, when heated to 1508 K or more, it transforms into its beta form, which has a body-centered cubic structure
<BR>- unlike other rare earth elements, gadolinium is relatively stable in dry air - however, it tarnishes quickly in moist air, forming a loosely-adhering oxide which spalls off, exposing more surface to oxidation
<BR>- is used for making gadolinium yttrium garnets, which have microwave applications, and gadolinium compounds are used for making phosphors for colour TV tubes
<BR>- is used in nuclear marine propulsion systems as a burnable poison
<BR>- has no known native biological role, but in research on biological systems it has a few roles - it is used as a component of MRI contrast agents
<BR>- is never found in nature as the free element, but is contained in many rare minerals such as monazite and bastnäsite
<BR>- occurs only in trace amounts in the mineral gadolinite, which was also named after Johan Gadolin
<BR>- as with the other lanthanides, gadolinium compounds are of low to moderate toxicity, although their toxicity has not been investigated in detail
<BR>- in patients with renal failure or other pro- inflammatory conditions, there is data associating its use with development of nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy as a side effect of gadolinium chelates used as a contrast agent for MRI examinat</p>
