<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is the most reactive of the rare earth elements; it rapidly oxidizes in air, and resembles calcium in its reaction with water
<BR>- ignites in air at about 150 °C to 180 °C
<BR>- is about as hard as lead and quite ductile
<BR>- is a metal and becomes a superconductor under pressure 80 GPa at temperature 1.8 K
<BR>- has been used to dope some types of glass to make lasers, as well as for screening for Down syndrome and some other genetic diseases
<BR>- due to its amazing ability to absorb neutrons, it is also being studied for use in nuclear reactors
<BR>- europium oxide (Eu2O3) is widely used as a red phosphor in television sets and fluorescent lamps, and as an activator for yttrium-based 
<BR>- is never found in nature as a free element; however, there are many minerals containing europium, with the most important sources being bastnäsite and monazite
<BR>- the metal dust presents a fire and explosion hazard
<BR>- has no known biological function</p>
