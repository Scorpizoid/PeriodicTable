<p><b>Symbol</b>: Lu<BR>
<b>Atomic number</b>: 71<BR>
<b>Category</b>: lanthanides<BR>
<b>Group</b>: n/a<BR>
<b>Period</b>: 6<BR>
<b>Block</b>: f<BR>
<b>Standard atomic weight</b>: 174.967<BR>
<b>Electrons per shell</b>: 2, 8, 18, 32, 9, 2<BR>

<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>Lutetia</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: the Latin name of Paris; the discoverer was French
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is a silvery white corrosion-resistant trivalent metal that is relatively stable in air
<BR>- is the heaviest and hardest of the rare earth elements
<BR>- has the highest melting point of any lanthanide, probably related to the lanthanide contraction
<BR>- is very expensive to obtain in useful quantities and therefore it has very few commercial uses
<BR>- stable lutetium can be used as catalysts in petroleum cracking in refineries and can also be used in alkylation, hydrogenation and polymerization
<BR>- lutetium-176 has been used to date the age of meteorites
<BR>- was proposed with names aldebaranium, neoytterbium, cassiopium and lutecium
<BR>- found with almost all other rare-earth metals but never by itself, lutetium is very difficult to separate
<BR>- is one of the most expensive metals, costing about six times as much as gold
<BR>- is regarded as having a low degree of toxicity but it and especially its compounds should be handled with care nonetheless
<BR>- metal dust of this element is a fire and explosion hazard
<BR>- plays no biological role in the human body</p>
