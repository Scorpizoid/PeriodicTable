<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is a soft, malleable and rather ductile element that exhibits a bright silvery luster
<BR>- is a rare earth of the lanthanide series and is found in the minerals gadolinite, monazite and xenotime
<BR>- is sometimes associated with yttrium or other related elements and is used in certain steels
<BR>- natural ytterbium is a mix of seven stable isotopes
<BR>- as a rare and expensive, thulium does not have many practical applications
<BR>- is fairly stable, it nevertheless should be stored in closed containers to protect it from air and moisture
<BR>- compounds of ytterbium should be treated as highly toxic although initial studies appear to indicate that the danger is limited
<BR>- is used e.g. as a source of X-rays, in doping of stainless steel, and in solar cells
<BR>- metallic ytterbium dust poses a fire and explosion hazard</p>
