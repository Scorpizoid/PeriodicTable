<p><b>Symbol</b>: Xe<BR>
<b>Atomic number</b>: 54<BR>
<b>Category</b>: noble gases<BR>
<b>Group</b>: 18<BR>
<b>Period</b>: 5<BR>
<b>Block</b>: p<BR>
<b>Standard atomic weight</b>: 131.293<BR>
<b>Electrons per shell</b>: 2, 8, 18, 18, 8<BR>
<b>CAS number</b>: 7440-63-3<BR>
<b>Phase</b>: gas<BR>
<b>Density</b>: 5.894 g/l (0 °C, 101.325 kPa)<BR>
<b>Melting point</b>: (101.325 kPa) 161.4 K (-111.7 C,

<b>Electronegativity</b>: 2.6 (Pauling scale)<BR>
<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>xenos</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: a Greek word which means 'stranger' because it's found so little in the Earth's atmosphere
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- occurs in the Earth's atmosphere in trace amounts (0.087 ppm)
<BR>- although generally unreactive, xenon can undergo a few chemical reactions such as the formation of xenon hexafluoroplatinate, the first noble gas compound to be synthesized
<BR>- is used in flash lamps and arc lamps, and as a general anesthetic
<BR>- is also being used to search for hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles and as the propellant for ion thrusters in spacecraft
<BR>- can be safely kept in normal sealed glass or metal containers at standard temperature and pressure, although it readily dissolves in most plastics and rubber, and will gradually escape from a container sealed with such material
<BR>- naturally occurring xenon consists of nine stable isotopes, and there are also over 40 unstable isotopes that undergo radioactive decay</p>
