<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>stannum</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: the lead-silver alloy of the same name for the finding of the latter in ores
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table
<BR>- a silvery, malleable poor metal which is not easily oxidized in air, and is used to coat other metals to prevent corrosion
<BR>- due to its low toxicity, tin-plated metal is also used for food packaging, giving the name to tin cans, which are made mostly out of aluminium or tin-plated steel
<BR>- plays no known natural biological role in humans, and possible health effects of tin are a subject of dispute - tin itself is not toxic but most tin salts are
<BR>- organotin compounds are very toxic - tri-n- alkyltins are phytotoxic and depending on the organic groups, they can be powerful bactericides and fungicides
<BR>- resists corrosion from distilled, sea and soft tap water, but can be attacked by strong acids, alkalis, and acid salts</p>
