<b>Name's meaning</b>: the village where the element was found
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is a rare, silvery, white metallic lanthanide which is solid in its normal state
<BR>- is malleable (or easily shaped), soft yet stable in air, and does not oxidize as quickly as some other rare-earth metals
<BR>- its salts are rose-colored, and the element has characteristic sharp absorption spectra bands in visible light, ultraviolet, and near infrared
<BR>- does not play any known biological role, but is thought by some to be able to stimulate metabolism
<BR>- is commonly used as a photographic filter, and because of its resilience it is useful as a metallurgical additive
<BR>- its estimated abundance in the Earth's crust is 1.3 mg/kg
<BR>- the mineral gadolinite was spearated into three fractions which was called yttria, erbia, and terbia - erbia and terbia, however, were confused at this time, and after 1860, terbia was renamed erbia and after 1877 what had been known as erbia was renamed terbia
<BR>- is never found as a free element in nature but is found bound in monazite sand ores
<BR>- has historically been very difficult and expensive to separate rare earths from each other in their ores but ion-exchange production techniques developed in the late 20th century have greatly brought down the cost of production of all rare-earth metals and their chemical compounds
<BR>- metallic erbium in dust form presents a fire and explosion hazard</p>
