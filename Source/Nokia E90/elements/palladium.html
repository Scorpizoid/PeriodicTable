<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is a rare and lustrous silvery-white metal
<BR>- over half of the supply of palladium and its sister metal platinum goes into catalytic converters, which convert up to 90% of harmful gases from auto exhaust (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide) into less harmful substances (nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapor)
<BR>- is found in many electronics including computers, mobile phones, multi-layer ceramic capacitors, component plating, low voltage electrical contacts, and SED/OLED/LCD televisions
<BR>- when palladium supply from Russia was delayed in the year 2000, the market panic drove its price to $1100 per ounce in January 2000 - Ford bought it with this price, and when the price dropped in the spring of 2001, Ford had paid nearly $1 billion dollars too much compared to the spring's asking price</p>
