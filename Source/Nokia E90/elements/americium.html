<font size=4em>Americium </font>
<p><b>Symbol</b>: Am<BR>
<b>Atomic number</b>: 95<BR>
<b>Category</b>: actinides<BR>
<b>Group</b>: n/a<BR>
<b>Period</b>: 7<BR>
<b>Block</b>: f<BR>
<b>Standard atomic weight</b>: (243)<BR>
<b>Electrons per shell</b>: 2, 8, 18, 32, 25, 8, 2<BR>
<b>CAS number</b>: 7440-35-9<BR>
<b>Phase</b>: solid<BR>
<b>Density</b>: 12 kg/l (near room temperature)<BR>
<b>Melting point</b>: 1449 K (1176 °C, 2149 °F)<BR>
<b>Boiling point</b>: 2880 K (2607 °C, 4725 °F)<BR>
<b>Crystal structure</b>: hexagonal<BR>
<b>Oxidation states</b>: 3, 4, 5, 6<BR>
<b>Electronegativity</b>: 1.3 (Pauling scale)<BR>
<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>America</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: by analogy with europium which was named after Europe
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- has a silvery and white luster
<BR>- slowly tarnishes in dry air
<BR>- is more silvery than plutonium or neptunium and apparently more malleable than neptunium or uranium
<BR>- is unlikely that Americium would be used as a weapons material, as its minimum critical mass is considerably larger than that of more readily obtained plutonium or uranium isotopes
<BR>- is widely used in commercial ionization-chamber smoke detectors as well as in neutron sources and industrial gauges
<BR>- eighteen radioisotopes of americium have been characterized, with the most stable being americium-243 with a half-life of 7370 years
<BR>- americium-241 has recently been suggested for use as a denaturing agent in plutonium reactor fuel rods to render the fuel unusable for conversion to nuclear weapons</p>
