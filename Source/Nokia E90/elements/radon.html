<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, naturally occurring, radioactive noble gas that is formed from the decay of radium
<BR>- is one of the heaviest substances that remains a gas under normal conditions and is considered to be a health hazard
<BR>- the most stable isotope, radon-222, has a half- life of 3.8 days
<BR>- will continue to exist indefinitely at about the same levels as it is now
<BR>- is responsible for the majority of the mean public exposition to ionizing radiations, it is often the single largest contributor to an individual's background radiation dose
<BR>- is reportedly the second most frequent cause of lung cancer, after cigarette smoking; and radon- induced lung cancer the 6th leading cause of cancer death overall
<BR>- the radon itself isn't very dangerous, but its radioactive decay products are - polonium-218 and 214 - which remain lodged in the lungs, and continue to decay, causing continued exposure by emitting alpha radiations</p>
