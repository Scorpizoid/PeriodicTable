<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>Germania</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: the Latin word for Germany, after the discoverer's father land
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- five naturally occurring isotopes ranging in atomic mass number from 70 to 76
<BR>- is relatively abundant in the Earth's crust
<BR>- is an important semiconductor material used in transistors and various other electronic devices
<BR>- is mined primarily from sphalerite, though it is also recovered from silver, lead, and copper ores
<BR>- is not thought to be essential to the health of plants or animals
<BR>- most notable physical characteristics of germania (GeO2) are its high index of refraction and its low optical dispersion - these make it especially useful for wide-angle camera lenses, microscopy, and for the core part of optical fibers
<BR>- has little or no impact on the environment because it usually occurs only as a trace element in ores and carbonaceous materials, and is used in very small quantities in commercial applications</p>
