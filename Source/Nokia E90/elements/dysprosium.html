<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>dysprositos</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: a Greek word which means 'hard to get' - the discoverer tried to isolate the element more than 30 times
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is a rare earth element with a metallic silver luster
<BR>- is never found in nature as a free element, though it is found in various minerals, such as xenotime
<BR>- is relatively stable in air at room temperature, but it dissolves readily in mineral acids
<BR>- is used for its high thermal neutron absorption cross-section in making control rods in nuclear reactors, for its high magnetic susceptibility to magnetization in data storage devices and as a component of Terfenol-D (a metal alloy)
<BR>- soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic, while the insoluble salts are considered non-toxic
<BR>- has no known biological role
<BR>- most dysprosium is being obtained from the ion- adsorption clay ores of southern China
<BR>- is used, in conjunction with vanadium and other elements, in making laser materials
<BR>- Dy powder may present an explosion hazard when mixed with air and when an ignition source is present
<BR>- dysprosium fires cannot be put out by water - it can react with water to produce flammable hydrogen gas</p>
