<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is a highly reactive nonmetallic period 2 element that readily forms compounds (notably oxides) with almost all other elements
<BR>- at standard temperature and pressure two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless, odorless, tasteless diatomic gas
<BR>- is the third most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen and helium
<BR>- diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.9% of the volume of air
<BR>- all major classes of structural molecules in living organisms, such as proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, contain oxygen, as do the major inorganic compounds that comprise animal shells, teeth and bone
<BR>- another form (allotrope) of oxygen, ozone (O3), helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation with the high-altitude ozone layer, but is a pollutant near the surface where it is a by-product of smog
<BR>- is produced industrially by fractional distillation of liquefied air, use of zeolites to remove carbon dioxide and nitrogen from air, electrolysis of water and other means
<BR>- is used in the production of steel, plastics and textiles; rocket life support in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving
<BR>- highly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion, yet the oxygen itself is not the fuel but the oxidant</p>
