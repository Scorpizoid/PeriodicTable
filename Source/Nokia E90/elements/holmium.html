<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is a relatively soft and malleable silvery-white metallic element
<BR>- is stable in dry air at room temperature
<BR>- is found in the minerals monazite and gadolinite, not as a free element
<BR>- quickly oxidizes in moist air, forming a yellowish oxide
<BR>- is commercially extracted via ion-exchange from monazite sand (0.05% holmium) but is still difficult to separate from other rare earths
<BR>- its estimated abundance in the Earth's crust is 1.3 mg/kg
<BR>- plays no biological role in humans but may be able to stimulate metabolism
<BR>- as with other rare earths, appears to have a low degree of acute toxicity
<BR>- because of its magnetic properties, holmium has been used to create the strongest artificially generated magnetic fields when placed within high-strength magnets as a magnetic pole piece
<BR>- ince it can absorb nuclear fission-bred neutrons, the element is also used in nuclear control rods
<BR>- is also used as a yellow or red glass coloring</p>
