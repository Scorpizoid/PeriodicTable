<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>iodes</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: a Greek word which means 'violet' due to its color
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is the second least reactive of the halogens, and the second most electropositive halogen
<BR>- does not occur in the free state in nature
<BR>- iodine and its compounds are primarily used in medicine, photography and dyes
<BR>- its compounds, the iodides, are very soluble in water, and the element is concentrated in seawater
<BR>- the element is required in trace amounts by all animals and some plants, being the heaviest element commonly used by living organisms (only tungsten, used in enzymes by a few bacteria, is heavier)
<BR>- iodine is a famous tester for starch - it dyes the starch blue
<BR>- its main role in animal biology is as constituents of the thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) and triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>)
<BR>- excess iodine has symptoms similar to those of iodine deficiency - commonly encountered symptoms are abnormal growth of the thyroid gland and disorders in functioning and growth of the organism as a whole</p>
