<b>Name's meaning</b>: the Norse god of thunder - the element was discovered in Norway
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is a silvery-white metal which is air-stable and retains its luster for several months
<BR>- when contaminated with the oxide, thorium slowly tarnishes in air, becoming gray and finally black
<BR>- is soft, very ductile, and can be cold-rolled, swaged and drawn
<BR>- powdered thorium metal is often pyrophoric and should be handled carefully
<BR>- is used e.g. as an alloying agent in magnesium, in uranium-thorium age dating and as a radiation shield
<BR>- is found in small amounts in most rocks and soils, where it is about four times more abundant than uranium, and is about as common as lead
<BR>- decays very slowly compared to many other radioactive materials, and the alpha radiation emitted cannot penetrate human skin meaning owning and handling small amounts of thorium, such as a gas mantle, is considered safe
<BR>- exposure to an aerosol of thorium can lead to increased risk of cancers of the lung, pancreas and blood</p>
