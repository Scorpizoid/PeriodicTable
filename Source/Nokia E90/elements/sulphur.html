<b>Name's origin</b>: <i>sulpur, sulphur or sulfur</i><BR>
<b>Name's meaning</b>: the Latin word for brimstone, the non-scientific name of the sulfur crystals
<BR><b>Facts</b>:<BR>- is a yellow crystalline solid
<BR>- it can be found as the pure element and as sulfide and sulfate minerals
<BR>- is an essential element for life and is found in two amino acids, cysteine and methionine
<BR>- is used primarily in fertilizers, but it is also widely used in black gunpowder, matches, insecticides and fungicides
<BR>- elemental sulfur crystals are commonly sought after by mineral collectors for their brightly colored polyhedron shapes 
<BR>- has only a faint odor, similar to that of matches
<BR>- burns with a blue flame that emits sulfur dioxide, notable for its peculiar suffocating odor due to dissolving in the mucosa to form dilute sulfurous acid
<BR>- the compound hydrogen sulfide is toxic - although very pungent at first, it quickly deadens the sense of smell, so potential victims may be unaware of its presence until death or other symptoms occur</p>
