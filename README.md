For chemistry students and enthusiasts here's the essential application for Series 80 - the periodic table of the chemical elements. It shows some basic and advanced information on the selected element - for example the group, period, block, symbol, atomic weight, CAS number, [i]where its name comes from[/i], and different curiosities, such as where it's used in and where it's found. Works on all Series 80 devices (Nokia 9210, 9210i, 9300, 9300i ja 9500).The usable buttons are up, down, left, right and Enter. In October 2011 I received an e-mail from a chemist from National academy of sciences of Belarus, and he requested the source code from me so the app could be modernized further and localized into his language. I decided to share the full source pack, see below.

Release history
1.00:
- the initial release

1.01:
- redone UI: now faster and shows the name and the number of the element without having to open it
- temperatures now have that fancy degree sign (e.g. before it was only like 434 C)
+ some minor bug fixes

1.02:
- cursor roll-around (when the user presses right in e.g. neon, the cursor goes to lithium)
- corrected the element type colours in the table (the new color is white)
- changed the menu entry "Tools" to "Help"
- the "Help" menu entry now includes the explanations of the different colours in the table, named "Table colours"
- the element's icon is new (in the left hand side of the dialog when the element's card is opened)
- the radioactive elements have their own symbol, just press Enter on e.g. Darmstadtium to see

1.03:
- corrected colours in the S80 app icons (= white included in the table)
- there's now a new CBA button - "Open" - available, which does what pressing Enter does
